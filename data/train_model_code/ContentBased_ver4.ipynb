Dynamic service selection allows selecting Web service instances during runtime by means of semantic clas- sications. The selection can be influenced by specifying dierent constraints. We present a generic approach for load balanced and high available services using automatic service replication. Both approaches, dynamic service selection and automatic service replication, support the development of reliable services. Additionally, our system supports mobile code, i.e., Web services can be distributed and instantiated during runtime on demand. This feature opens a great optimization potential and additionally contributes to reliable service execution because unavailable hosts can be replaced dynamically by available hosts. We present these techniques within the scope of the ServiceGlobe system, an open platform for Web service specication, execution, and deployment.\",\n          \"Automated negotiation by software agents is a key enabling technology for agent mediated e-commerce. To this end, this paper considers an important class of such negotiations - namely those in which an agent engages in multiple concurrent bilateral negotiations for a good or service. In particular, we consider the situation in which a buyer agent is looking for a single service provider from a number of available ones in its environment. By bargaining simultaneously with these providers and interleaving partial agreements that it makes with them, a buyer can reach good deals in an efficient manner. However, a key problem in such encounters is managing commitments since an agent may want to make intermediate deals (so that it has a definite agreement) with other agents before it gets to finalize a deal at the end of the encounter. To do this effectively, however, the agents need to have a flexible model of commitments that they can reason about in order to determine when to commit and to decommit. This paper provides and evaluates such a commitment manager and integrates it into the negotiation model.\",\n          \"this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the computationalenvironment parameters that were varied in the simulations. Descriptionsof the 11 mapping heuristics are found in Section 3.

A list of implementation parameters andprocedures that could be varied for each heuristic is presented in Section 5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"published_year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 53,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1987\",\n          \"1968\",\n          \"1956\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["# Import Pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Load Movies Metadata\n","metadata = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Buom/ver4/Paper.csv\", low_memory=False)\n","\n","metadata.head(10)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## GET NEWEST PAPERS\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HMa-0DiWWUc8"},"id":"HMa-0DiWWUc8"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = metadata.copy()\n","df = df.query(\"published_year != r'\\\\N'\")\n","df['published_year'] = df['published_year'].astype(int)\n","df = df.sort_values('published_year', ascending=False)\n","df[['paper_id', 'title', 'published_year']].head(20)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":676},"id":"sCTtRgmLXB4D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709907466532,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Duc Duong","userId":"05119256564902054384"}},"outputId":"b6c4a13a-7db4-4966-ae19-c3ff87a9c7e3"},"id":"sCTtRgmLXB4D","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       paper_id                                              title  \\\n","16038   1832722  Implicators based on binary aggregation operat...   \n","19528   2735743  The Challenge of Visualizing Patient Histories...   \n","6506     507928  Multi-Server Queueing Systems with Multiple Pr...   \n","13439   1530576  An Ontology-Based Pattern Mining System for Ex...   \n","6492     505622  A Web Services-Based Universal Approach to Het...   \n","19537   2738129                       The Bunch-Active Shape Model   \n","13455   1535232  Cryptanalysis of an MPEG-Video Encryption Sche...   \n","19532   2736480  Fuzzy logic based multi-optimum programming in...   \n","19531   2736422     Meta-Toys Workshop and Environment with Squeak   \n","13457   1535531  A generic framework of user attention model an...   \n","13478   1539157  Region-based Matching for Robust 3D Face Recog...   \n","13479   1539158         Subspace Learning Based on Tensor Analysis   \n","19555   2742128  Improving target acquisition for pointing inpu...   \n","6459     501160  Optimizing Physical Design of Multidimensional...   \n","13485   1540690  Fingerprint classification using fast Fourier ...   \n","13492   1542512  A Probabilistic Multimodal Sensor Aggregation ...   \n","6453     500178  Multi-modal Image Registration by Quantitative...   \n","19510   2731720                      Animating pervasive computing   \n","13498   1544884    An Information Acquiring Channel -
